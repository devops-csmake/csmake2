class translatePackageName(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Allow a single name to be used in the metadata for a dependent
                package.  
       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Description:
           The metadata may include dependent names for packages.  Not every
           packaging scheme follows the same naming or naming conventions for
           packages.

           This module allows the build developer to define the desired
           translation from the name for a package used in the metadata to
           a name that suits the packaging scheme.

           A Packager derived module, for example, may consult this section
           for the apropos package name for a given package.

           The section should be defined with an id that is the canonical name
           for the package desired to be used in the metadata surrounded by
           tildes to avoid any overlapping ids.

           The lookup will look for a section defined:
                [translatePackageName@~~<package>~~]
               (where <package> is the canonical name desired for the package)

       Phases: *any*
       Options:
           <key> - <package name(s)>
                   Where <key> is the packaging scheme target
                   'package name(s)' is the name(s) of the package
                        in the given format.  The full 'depends' syntax
                        may be used.
                   Leaving 'package name(s)' empty indicates that the
                        package is not required for the platform indicated
                        by '<key>'.
                   NOTE: The default Packager behavior is to do the following
                      1) If a single package is specified, and no version
                         is specified, the version tied to the original package
                         name from the metadata is used (if any)
                      2) If multiple packages are specified,
                         a version specifier '{version}' will use the
                         original version.  e.g.:
                         From the metadata:

                         [metadata@mypackage-metadata]
                         ...
                         depends: mydep (<= 5.4.3)

                         in the translate section (say we're doing rpms):
                         [translatePackageName@~~mydep~~]
                         rpm = thisotherdep (< 2.1), mydep-g1 ({version})

                         mydep-g1 would get the same version: <= 5.4.3
                      (N.B.: Specific Packager implementations may do
                         something different)

           ~~format~~ - (NOT RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL)
                   Normally, the Packager based module will define this field
                   However, if for some reason you want to set this
                   (say you have non-conforming key or Packager needs)
                   You can use this option to tell this section which key to
                   use.
       Example:
           [metadata@myproduct]
           name: myproduct
           depends: python (> 2.7.11), anotherproduct

           #The ~~ avoids collision with the python section
           [translatePackageName@~~anotherproduct~~]
           rpm=another-project, another-project-devel
           alpine=anotherpjt
           #This would say that the "anotherproduct" dependency isn't necessary
           #  for the cygwin platform:
           cygwin=

           [translatePackageName@~~python~~]
           rpm=python-minimal ({version}), python-devel
           debian=python ({version}), python-dev
           cygwin=python (> 2.5.2)

           [Shell@python]
           command=python -m myMod
