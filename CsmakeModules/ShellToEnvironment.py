class ShellToEnvironment(CsmakeModuleAllPhase):
    """Purpose: Puts a shell environment variable into the csmake environment
       Type: Module   Library: csmake (core)
       Description:
                This enables the ability to paramiterize a build
                - should be used with caution as this opens builds
                  up to depend on a specific shell context to work properly
                  which is antithetical to the theory of operation
                  behind csmake
                *Options substitutions, e.g., %(var)s, are NOT allowed*
       Phases: *any*
       Options: <shell variable>[:<default value>]
                Adds all flags into the environment for future steps
                The value is a shell variable that should have been
                defined before csmake was executed.
                A default value may be added using a colon ':' followed
                by the default value
       Example:
           [ShellToEnvironment@pull-parameters]
           csmake-build-number=BUILDNO
           branch-to-pull=BRANCH:master

           The 'pull-parameters' section would pull 'BUILDNO' from the
           shell enivronment that csmake is executing from and place it
           in the csmake environment variable called "csmake-build-number"
           Likewise with 'BRANCH', 'branch-to-pull' would be set to
           whatever ${BRANCH} would evaluate to from the shell that launched
           csmake.  
           If BRANCH isn't defined in the shell environment, the 'master'
              is used in its place.
